# Key Algorithms
<details>
<summary><strong> Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong></summary>
  
#### ![About](https://img.shields.io/badge/About-orange)
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm used to efficiently compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence or time-domain signal. It is a fundamental tool in signal processing and mathematics, enabling the transformation of data from the time domain to the frequency domain. By doing so, it reveals the frequency components present in the original signal, providing valuable insights for various applications.

#### ![Usage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Usage-yellow)
The FFT finds extensive use in a wide range of fields, including audio and video processing, telecommunications, image analysis, data compression, and scientific research. Its ability to efficiently analyze and extract frequency information from signals has made it a cornerstone in modern technology.

#### ![How It Works](https://img.shields.io/badge/How_It_Works-blue)
The FFT algorithm employs a "divide-and-conquer" approach to efficiently compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It reduces the number of calculations needed from O(n^2) (for the direct DFT computation) to O(n log n), where n is the number of data points in the signal.

The main idea behind the FFT is to break down the original DFT computation into smaller subproblems and combine the results to obtain the final frequency-domain representation. By recursively dividing the signal into even and odd-indexed components, it constructs the DFT in a highly efficient manner. This process is often illustrated using a butterfly diagram, which shows how data points are combined during each stage of the computation.

In summary, the Fast Fourier Transform is a powerful algorithm that transforms signals from the time domain to the frequency domain efficiently. Its ability to analyze and extract frequency components has revolutionized various fields, making it an indispensable tool for signal processing and analysis tasks.

<summary><strong> Peak Detection</strong></summary>

#### ![About](https://img.shields.io/badge/About-orange)
Peak detection is a signal processing technique used to identify local maxima and minima within a dataset. Peaks represent significant points in the data, often indicating the presence of important features, spikes, or anomalies. This technique is widely used in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, audio processing, and scientific research.

#### ![Usage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Usage-yellow)
Peak detection has numerous applications in different domains. In audio processing, it can be utilized to detect musical notes, beats, or sudden loud sounds. In image processing, peak detection helps identify edges or prominent features in images. In data analysis, it is valuable for detecting important data points in various types of datasets, such as financial data, sensor readings, or biological signals.

#### ![How It Works](https://img.shields.io/badge/How_It_Works-blue)
The process of peak detection typically involves scanning through the dataset to find points that are greater (peaks) or smaller (valleys) than their neighboring data points. Various algorithms can be employed for peak detection, and their selection depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired level of sensitivity.

One of the common peak detection techniques is the "slope-based" method, where the algorithm looks for points where the slope changes from positive to negative (peaks) or negative to positive (valleys). Another approach is the "window-based" method, where the algorithm examines data points within a defined window and identifies the maximum or minimum value within that window as a peak.

The choice of the appropriate peak detection algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the noise present in the dataset. Ensuring accurate peak detection often involves a trade-off between sensitivity to small peaks and robustness against noise and fluctuations.

In summary, peak detection is a valuable tool in signal processing and data analysis that allows for the identification of significant points within datasets. Its versatility and widespread applications make it an essential technique for extracting valuable information from various types of signals and data.
